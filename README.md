          <p>
            Three months may not seem like a long time, but to me, it already
            feels like we’ve built something really special.
          </p>

          <p>
            In just a short time, you’ve become someone I look forward to every
            day—someone who makes my ordinary moments feel brighter and my heavy
            days feel lighter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for being patient with me, for understanding me, and for
            choosing me even when things aren’t perfect. I love how you care so
            deeply, and how you make me feel safe just by being you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being with you has taught me what it means to love gently, honestly,
            and wholeheartedly.
          </p>

          <p>
            These past three months have given me so many memories I’ll always
            treasure, and they’ve made me excited for everything that’s still
            ahead of us.
          </p>

          <p>
            If this is just the beginning, then I can’t wait to see how much
            more we’ll grow together. ❤️
          </p>

          <p>I choose you now and forever. ❤️</p>
